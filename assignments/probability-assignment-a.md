# Probability Assignment A

## Exercise 1 

A data scientist develops a model of the mortality probability distribution function 

$$p(t) = 3 \times 10^{-9} t^2(100-t^2),  0 \le t \le 100 ~\text{years}$$

$p(t)$ is 0.0 outside the above range of $t$.

a. What is the probability that a person will die between 60 and 70. 
b. What is the probability that a person will die between 60 and 70, given that was alive at 60.
