title: Gaussian Processes Assignment
---

Gaussian Processes play an instrumental role in probabilistic modeling. In this assignment you are asked to 

1. Learn the fundamentals of GPs e.g. from [here](https://peterroelants.github.io/posts/gaussian-process-tutorial/) or [there](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsta.2011.0550). Write a set of notes (mixing markdown and from scratch Python code) that can be useful for someone that is just getting starting on GPs to get to known them. Research the topic and do not confine the treatment to only those sources. 
   
2. Use [this TF Probability notebook](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/examples/Gaussian_Process_Regression_In_TFP)  that applies Gaussian processes in the well known noisy sinusoidal dataset. 

3.
