# Micro-mobility Simulation

![taxi-dropoffs-map](images/taxi-dropoffs-map.png#center)

In this project, imagine that a pandemic hit NYC (imagine that) and that your local government wants to implement controls to all residents and visitors. As you can imagine in a free society imposing blanket rules can only degrade the already bad psychological state of the residents and can also be ineffective. People may not adhere to such rules and policing them is infeasible. 

The mayor contacts your data science organization and asks for help. 

"Is there a system you can design that can one one hand will not prohibit people's mobility but on the other will very smartly control it such that it can prevent overcrowding in popular places?"  

You and the other data scientists in your org need to come up with an answer quickly and you start sketching a response as follows:

1. You can walk and jog within 0.5 mile radius around your primary residence listed in your driver's license. 
2. You can go to the supermarket and pharmacy using your own car. 
3. You can 
4. To move Although you will participate in a Kaggle competition. If this is your first competition don't despair as thousands of other engineers have learned to excel in competitions such as this - a good ranking can lift your resume out of the noise and draw the attention of recruiters. In this class we will _not_ judge your performance against the _global_ Kaggle leader board but we will focus only on relative performance with the other teams in this class. 

Now, head over to the [competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction/overview) and go over the description, the evaluation metrics and the getting started guide. You dont need to develop your notebook in Kaggle (please note that Kaggle is owned by Google as well) - you can download the data in your google drive and use Google's colab. You may want to run though some existing notebooks authored by others that participated in the competition and are already hosted in Kaggle (Notebooks tab) within the Kaggle runtime environment to test the waters. 

If you find that the runtime environment in Colab with the dataset of the competition has memory issues, please consider sampling the dataset to a smaller number of rows. The original dataset is 55M rows and the starter code reduced this to 10M rows. Colab is constantly upgrading its hardware so this may not be needed.
