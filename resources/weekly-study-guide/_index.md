#  Your study guide after each lecture

## Introduction to Data Science

1. Go through the notes and the what the syllabus says as reading list. 
2. Go through the interactive Python tutorial (IBM is recommended) so you can be ready for next time. 

## Python Refresher

This lecture is mostly to walk through the python implementation of an end to end pipeline. As such it was dry on concepts and difficult to deliver honestly and the elements of the pipeline are many. The book chapter that explains it all will be posted in Discord. You should do the following until the next lecture:

1. Make sure you know how to use the colab environment 
2. Finish the interactive python tutorial
3. Go through the code of the end to end pipeline and make sure you can topologically map the code to the stage of the pipeline. 
4. Review basic probability from the syllabus reading list - I will go through this on Monday as well. 


## The Learning Problem 

This is a very important lecture and you need to 

1. Focus understanding the block diagram that is associated with the supervised learning setting. 
2. Go through the sinusoidal dataset example and make sure you can map the process there to the block diagram. 
3. Understand key terms such as overfitting and regularization. 
4. For those that don't have background in random variables, make sure you run the notebooks / code associated with the ISL Chapter 2 and the chapters mentioned in the syllabus in the GRUS book.
