# Study Guide for Midterm

**General guidelines**

1. Study from the notes and focus on critically understanding the concepts. Read from the two books _only_ the _whole_ sections that overlap with the notes using the syllabus as the guide.   
2. There will be no definition questions e.g. what is a decision tree. 
3. There will be no  mathematical derivations (all formulas needed will be given). 
4. Some questions will be computational - make sure you have access to a calculator 
5. Some questions will be multiple choice
6. Some questions will include a figure and you will be asked to explain it. 

**Logistics**

1. Conference in at the time of the exam and turn on your camera. Make sure you are in a place that is quiet and no one will interrupt you.
2. Link to the test will be given to you on Webex, you need to download it and bring it up on the screen. 
3. You need to have empty sheets of paper, pencil / pen and eraser. 
4. Ask clarification questions via conference chat sent to "Everyone" so other can benefit from the responses.  
5. Smartphones will be allowed only at the end to scan your write ups and upload them into canvas. To scan you need to use CamScanner or GeniousScan or any other app of your choice that can generate PDF files of your scans. in your smartphones. 
6. At the end of the exam you will upload into the corresponding Canvas assignment your pdf file(s) **AND** send then by email to the TA. You need to use your University email account for that. 

**Topics**

| Topic    |  What to pay attention to   |
| --- | --- |
|  The learning problem   |  1. Understand the block diagram of supervised problem with the math.  |
| ML Estimation | 1. Understand what ML estimation is doing and be prepared to answer questions as to how it differs from the Bayesian setting. | 
|  Linear Regression  | 1. Understand what is regularization and how over-fitting is manifested.   |
|  Classification  |  1. Understand the problem setting and especially the classification metrics.   |
|  Back-propagation | 1. You may be given a simple network and ask to back-propagate it. | 
|  Optimization  |  1. Pay close attention how the gradient descent works and its behavior as it searches the space of weights. |   
| CNNs | 1. Understand the architecture elements and how they help in the learning process.  2. Understand how ResNets differ with earlier architectures such as VGG16 |
