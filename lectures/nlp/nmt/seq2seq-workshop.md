# Seq2Seq Workshop

You need to go through [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/word-level-english-to-marathi-neural-machine-translation-using-seq2seq-encoder-decoder-lstm-model-1a913f2dc4a7) implementation to understand the basic NMT mechanism and the dimensioning of the LSTMs involved. The code involves minimal high level Keras APIs. 

For high level Keras APIs, please go through this notebook.
