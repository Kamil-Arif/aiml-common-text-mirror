# Grad-CAM Workshop

The Grad-CAM has been implemented in tf-explain APIs and is readily available to use very easily. It is routinely used in practice to detect issues with object detection, classification and other computer vision tasks. As the APIs are open source you can access the implementation for details or read [other writeups](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2020/03/09/grad-cam-visualize-class-activation-maps-with-keras-tensorflow-and-deep-learning/)
