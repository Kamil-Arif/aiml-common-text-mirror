[These notes](https://www.cs.indiana.edu/~predrag/classes/2016fallb365x/ols.pdf) summarize the Maximum Likelihood approach and are provided here as they are more expansive compared to textbooks at this level and at the same time do make the connection to the [Linear Algebra background you should have]({{<ref "../../linear-algebra">}}).
