Yooreeka is a library for data mining, machine learning, soft computing,
and mathematical analysis. The project started with the code of the book
\"Algorithms of the Intelligent Web\". Although the term \"Web\"
prevailed in the title, in essence, the algorithms are valuable in any
software application. It covers all major algorithms and provides many
examples. Yooreeka 2.x is licensed under the Apache License rather than
the somewhat more restrictive LGPL (which was the license of v1.x). The
library is written 100% in the Java language. Algorithms The following
algorithms are covered: Clustering Hierarchical---Agglomerative (e.g.
MST single link; ROCK) and Divisive Partitional (e.g. k-means)
Classification Bayesian Decision trees Neural Networks Rule based (via
Drools) Recommendations Collaborative filtering Content based Search
PageRank DocRank Personalization References External links Baynoo
