The International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) is the leading
international academic conference in machine learning. Along with
NeurIPS and ICLR, it is one of the three primary conferences of high
impact in machine learning and artificial intelligence research. It is
supported by the (IMLS). Precise dates vary year to year, but paper
submissions are generally due at the end of January, and the conference
is generally held the following July. The first ICML was held 1980 in
Pittsburgh. Locations ICML 2026 Seoul, South Korea ICML 2025 Vancouver,
