In theoretical computer science and the study of machine learning, the
manifold hypothesis is the hypothesis that many high-dimensional data
sets that occur in the real world actually lie along low-dimensional
latent manifolds inside that high-dimensional space. As a consequence of
the manifold hypothesis, many data sets that appear to initially require
many variables to describe, can actually be described by a comparatively
small number of variables, likened to the local coordinate system of the
underlying manifold. It is suggested that this principle underpins the
effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in describing
high-dimensional data sets by considering a few common features. The
manifold hypothesis is related to the effectiveness of nonlinear
dimensionality reduction techniques in machine learning. Many techniques
of dimensional reduction make the assumption that data lies along a
low-dimensional submanifold, such as manifold sculpting, manifold
alignment, and manifold regularization. References Further reading
