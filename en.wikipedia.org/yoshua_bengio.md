Yoshua Bengio (born March 5, 1964) is a Canadian computer scientist,
most noted for his work on artificial neural networks and deep learning.
He is a professor at the Department of Computer Science and Operations
Research at the Université de Montréal and scientific director of the
Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA).Bengio received the
2018 ACM A.M. Turing Award, together with Geoffrey Hinton and Yann
LeCun, for their work in deep learning. Bengio, Hinton, and LeCun, are
sometimes referred to as the \"Godfathers of AI\" and \"Godfathers of
Deep Learning\". As of May 2023, he is the most cited computer scientist
by h-index. Early life and education Bengio was born in France to a
Jewish family who immigrated to France from Morocco, and then immigrated
again to Canada. He received his Bachelor of Science degree (electrical
engineering), MSc (computer science) and PhD (computer science) from
McGill University.Bengio is the brother of Samy Bengio, also an
influential computer scientist working with neural networks, who is
currently Senior Director of AI and ML Research at Apple. The Bengio
brothers lived in Morocco for a year during their father\'s military
service there. His father, Carlo Bengio, was a pharmacist who wrote
theatre pieces and ran a Sephardic theatrical troupe in Montreal that
played Judeo-Arabic pieces. His mother, Célia Moreno, is also an artist
who played in one of the major theatre scenes of Morocco that was run by
Tayeb Seddiki in the 1970s. Career and research After his PhD, Bengio
was a postdoctoral fellow at MIT (supervised by Michael I. Jordan) and
AT&T Bell Labs. Bengio has been a faculty member at the Université de
Montréal since 1993, heads the MILA (Montreal Institute for Learning
Algorithms) and is co-director of the Learning in Machines & Brains
project of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research.Along with
Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun, Bengio is considered by Cade Metz as one
of the three people most responsible for the advancement of deep
learning during the 1990s and 2000s. Among the computer scientists with
an h-index of at least 100, Bengio was as of 2018 the one with the most
recent citations per day, according to MILA. As of December 2022, he had
the 2nd highest Discipline H-index (D-index) in computer science. Thanks
to a 2019 article on a novel RNN architecture, Bengio has an Erdős
number of 3.In October 2016, Bengio co-founded Element AI, a
Montreal-based artificial intelligence incubator that turns AI research
into real-world business applications. The company sold its operations
to ServiceNow in November 2020, with Bengio remaining at ServiceNow as
an advisor.In May 2017, Bengio announced that he was joining
Montreal-based legal tech startup Botler AI, as a strategy adviser.
Bengio currently serves as scientific and technical advisor for
Recursion Pharmaceuticals and scientific advisor for Valence Discovery.
Awards and honours In 2017, Bengio was named an Officer of the Order of
Canada. The same year, he was nominated Fellow of the Royal Society of
Canada and received the Marie-Victorin Quebec Prize. Together with
Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun, Bengio won the 2018 Turing Award.In 2020
he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 2022 he received the
Princess of Asturias Award in the category \"Scientific Research\" with
his peers Yann LeCun, Geoffrey Hinton and Demis Hassabis. Publications
