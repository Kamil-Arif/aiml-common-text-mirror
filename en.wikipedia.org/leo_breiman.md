Leo Breiman (January 27, 1928 -- July 5, 2005) was a distinguished
statistician at the University of California, Berkeley. He was the
recipient of numerous honors and awards, and was a member of the United
States National Academy of Sciences. Breiman\'s work helped to bridge
the gap between statistics and computer science, particularly in the
field of machine learning. His most important contributions were his
work on classification and regression trees and ensembles of trees fit
to bootstrap samples. Bootstrap aggregation was given the name bagging
by Breiman. Another of Breiman\'s ensemble approaches is the random
forest. See also Shannon--McMillan--Breiman theorem Further reading Leo
