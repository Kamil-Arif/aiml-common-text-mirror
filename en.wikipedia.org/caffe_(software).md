Caffe (Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding) is a deep
learning framework, originally developed at University of California,
Berkeley. It is open source, under a BSD license. It is written in C++,
with a Python interface. History Yangqing Jia created the Caffe project
during his PhD at UC Berkeley. It is currently hosted on GitHub.
Features Caffe supports many different types of deep learning
architectures geared towards image classification and image
segmentation. It supports CNN, RCNN, LSTM and fully-connected neural
network designs. Caffe supports GPU- and CPU-based acceleration
computational kernel libraries such as Nvidia cuDNN and Intel MKL.
Applications Caffe is being used in academic research projects, startup
prototypes, and even large-scale industrial applications in vision,
speech, and multimedia. Yahoo! has also integrated Caffe with Apache
Spark to create CaffeOnSpark, a distributed deep learning framework.
Caffe2 In April 2017, Facebook announced Caffe2, which included new
features such as recurrent neural network (RNN). At the end of March
2018, Caffe2 was merged into PyTorch. See also Comparison of deep
