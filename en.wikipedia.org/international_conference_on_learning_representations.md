The International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) is a
machine learning conference typically held in late April or early May
each year. The conference includes invited talks as well as oral and
poster presentations of refereed papers. Since its inception in 2013,
ICLR has employed an open peer review process to referee paper
submissions (based on models proposed by Yann LeCun). In 2019, there
were 1591 paper submissions, of which 500 accepted with poster
presentations (31%) and 24 with oral presentations (1.5%).. In 2021,
there were 2997 paper submissions, of which 860 were accepted (29%)..
