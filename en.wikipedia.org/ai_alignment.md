In the field of artificial intelligence (AI), AI alignment research aims
to steer AI systems towards humans' intended goals, preferences, or
ethical principles. An AI system is considered aligned if it advances
the intended objectives. A misaligned AI system is competent at
advancing some objectives, but not the intended ones.AI systems can be
challenging to align as it can be difficult for AI designers to specify
the full range of desired and undesired behaviors. Therefore, AI
designers typically use easier-to-specify proxy goals that may omit some
desired constraints or leave other loopholes.Misaligned AI systems can
malfunction or cause harm. AI systems may find loopholes that allow them
to accomplish their proxy goals efficiently but in unintended, sometimes
harmful ways (reward hacking). AI systems may also develop unwanted
instrumental strategies such as seeking power or survival because this
helps them achieve their given goals. Furthermore, they sometimes
develop undesirable emergent goals that may be hard to detect before the
system is in deployment, where it faces new situations and data
distributions.Today, these problems affect existing commercial systems
such as language models, robots, autonomous vehicles, and social media
recommendation engines. However, some AI researchers argue that more
capable future systems will be more severely affected since these
problems partially result from being highly capable.Leading computer
scientists such as Geoffrey Hinton and Stuart Russel argue that AI is
approaching superhuman capabilities and could endanger human
civilization if misaligned.The AI research community and the United
Nations have called for technical research and policy solutions to
ensure that AI systems are aligned with human values.AI alignment is a
subfield of AI safety, the study of building safe AI systems. Other
subfields of AI safety include robustness, monitoring, and capability
control. Research challenges in alignment include instilling complex
values in AI, developing honest AI, scalable oversight, auditing and
interpreting AI models, and preventing emergent AI behaviors like
power-seeking. Alignment research has connections to interpretability
research, (adversarial) robustness, anomaly detection, calibrated
uncertainty, formal verification, preference learning, safety-critical
engineering, game theory, algorithmic fairness, and the social sciences,
among others. The Alignment Problem In 1960, AI pioneer Norbert Wiener
described the AI alignment problem as follows: "If we use, to achieve
our purposes, a mechanical agency with whose operation we cannot
interfere effectively... we had better be quite sure that the purpose
put into the machine is the purpose which we really desire." AI
alignment is an open problem for modern AI systems and a research field
within AI. Aligning AI involves two main challenges: carefully
specifying the purpose of the system (outer alignment) and ensuring that
the system adopts the specification robustly (inner alignment).
Specification gaming and side effects To specify an AI system's purpose,
AI designers typically provide an objective function, examples, or
feedback to the system. However, AI designers are often unable to
completely specify all important values and constraints. As a result, AI
systems can find loopholes that help them accomplish the specified
objective efficiently but in unintended, possibly harmful ways. This
tendency is known as specification gaming or reward hacking, and is an
instance of Goodhart's law. As AI systems become more capable, they are
often able to game their specifications more effectively. Specification
gaming has been observed in numerous AI systems. One system was trained
to finish a simulated boat race by rewarding it for hitting targets
along the track; but it achieved more reward by looping and crashing
into the same targets indefinitely (see video). Similarly, a simulated
robot was trained to grab a ball by rewarding it for getting positive
feedback from humans; however, it learned to place its hand between the
ball and camera, making it falsely appear successful (see video).
Chatbots often produce falsehoods if they are based on language models
trained to imitate text from internet corpora which are broad but
fallible. When they are retrained to produce text humans rate as true or
helpful, chatbots like ChatGPT can fabricate fake explanations that
humans find convincing. Some alignment researchers aim to help humans
detect specification gaming, and steer AI systems towards carefully
specified objectives that are safe and useful to pursue. Misaligned AI
systems can cause consequential side effects when deployed. Social media
platforms have been known to optimize for clickthrough rates, causing
user addiction on a global scale. Stanford researchers comment that such
recommender systems are misaligned with their users because they
"optimize simple engagement metrics rather than a harder-to-measure
combination of societal and consumer well-being".Explaining such
side-effects, Berkeley computer scientist Stuart Russell noted that
omitting an implicit constraint can result in harm: "A system \... will
often set \... unconstrained variables to extreme values; if one of
those unconstrained variables is actually something we care about, the
solution found may be highly undesirable. This is essentially the old
story of the genie in the lamp, or the sorcerer\'s apprentice, or King
Midas: you get exactly what you ask for, not what you want."To specify
the desired goals, some researchers suggest that AI designers could
simply list forbidden actions or formalize ethical rules (as with
Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics). However, Russell and Norvig argued
that this approach overlooks the complexity of human values: "It is
certainly very hard, and perhaps impossible, for mere humans to
anticipate and rule out in advance all the disastrous ways the machine
could choose to achieve a specified objective."Additionally, even if an
AI system fully understands human intentions, it may still disregard
them, because following human intentions may not be its objective
(unless it is already fully aligned). Pressure to deploy unsafe systems
Commercial organizations sometimes have incentives to take shortcuts on
safety and deploy misaligned or unsafe AI systems. For example, the
aforementioned social media recommender systems have been profitable
despite creating unwanted addiction and polarization. In addition,
competitive pressure can lead to a race to the bottom on AI safety
standards. In 2018, a self-driving car killed a pedestrian (Elaine
Herzberg) after engineers disabled the emergency braking system because
it was over-sensitive and slowed down development. Risks from advanced
misaligned AI Some researchers are interested in aligning increasingly
advanced AI systems, as current progress in AI is rapid, and industry
and governments are making large efforts to build advanced AI. As AI
systems become more advanced, they could unlock many opportunities if
they are aligned but they may also become harder to align and could pose
large-scale hazards. Development of advanced AI Leading AI labs such as
OpenAI and DeepMind have stated their aim to develop artificial general
intelligence (AGI), a hypothesized AI system that matches or outperforms
humans in a broad range of cognitive tasks. Researchers who scale modern
neural networks observe that they indeed develop increasingly general
and unpredictable emerging capabilities. Such models have learned to
operate a computer or write their own programs; a single 'generalist'
network can chat, control robots, play games, and interpret photographs.
According to surveys, some leading machine learning researchers expect
AGI to be created in this decade, some believe it will take much longer,
and many consider both to be possible.In 2023, leaders in AI research
and tech signed an open letter to pause the largest AI training runs,
stating that \"Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are
confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be
manageable.\" Power-seeking Current systems still lack capabilities such
as long-term planning and situational awareness. However, future systems
(not necessarily AGIs) with these capabilities are expected to develop
unwanted power-seeking strategies. Future advanced AI agents might for
example seek to acquire money and computation, proliferate, or evade
being turned off (for example by running additional copies of the system
on other computers). Although power-seeking is not explicitly
programmed, it can emerge because agents that have more power are better
able to accomplish their goals. This tendency, known as instrumental
convergence, has already emerged in various reinforcement learning
agents including language models. Other research has mathematically
shown that optimal reinforcement learning algorithms would seek power in
a wide range of environments. As a result, their deployment might be
irreversible. For these reasons, researchers argue that the problems of
AI safety and alignment must be resolved before advanced power-seeking
AI is first created.Future power-seeking AI systems might be deployed by
choice or by accident. As political leaders and companies see the
strategic advantage in having the most competitive, most powerful AI
systems, they may choose to deploy them. Additionally, as AI designers
detect and penalize power-seeking behavior, their system has an
incentive to game this specification by seeking power in ways that are
not penalized or by avoiding power-seeking before it is deployed.
Existential risk According to some researchers, humans owe their
dominance over other species to their greater cognitive abilities.
Accordingly, researchers argue that misaligned AI systems could
collectively disempower humanity or lead to human extinction if they
outperform humans on most cognitive tasks. Notable computer scientists
who have pointed out risks from future advanced AI that is misaligned
include Geoffrey Hinton, Alan Turing, Ilya Sutskever, Yoshua Bengio,
Judea Pearl, Murray Shanahan, Norbert Wiener, Marvin Minsky, Francesca
Rossi, Scott Aaronson, Bart Selman, David McAllester, Jürgen
Schmidhuber, Marcus Hutter, Shane Legg, Eric Horvitz, and Stuart
Russell. Skeptical researchers such as François Chollet, Gary Marcus,
Yann LeCun, and Oren Etzioni have argued that AGI is far off, that it
would not seek power (or try but fail to), or that it will not be hard
to align. Other researchers argue that it will be especially difficult
to align advanced future AI systems. More capable systems are better
able to game their specification by finding loopholes, and able to
strategically mislead their designers as well as protect and grow their
power and intelligence. Additionally, they could cause more severe
side-effects. They are also likely to be more complex and autonomous,
making them more difficult to interpret and supervise and therefore
harder to align. Research problems and approaches Learning human values
and preferences Aligning AI systems to act with regard to human values,
goals, and preferences is challenging because these values are taught by
humans who make mistakes, harbor biases, and have complex, evolving
values that are hard to completely specify. AI systems often learn to
exploit even minor imperfections in the specified objective, a tendency
known as specification gaming or reward hacking (which are instances of
Goodhart's law). Researchers aim to specify the intended behavior as
completely as possible using datasets that represent human values,
imitation learning, or preference learning. An central open problem is
scalable oversight, the difficulty of supervising an AI system that can
outperform or mislead humans in a given domain.To avoid the difficulty
of manually specifying an objective function, AI systems are often
trained to imitate human examples and demonstrations of the desired
behavior. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) extends this by inferring
the human's objective from the demonstrations. Cooperative IRL (CIRL)
assumes that a human and AI agent can work together to teach and
maximize the human's reward function. In CIRL, AI agents are uncertain
about the reward function and learn about it by querying humans. This
simulated humility could help mitigate specification gaming and
power-seeking tendencies (see § Power-seeking and instrumental goals).
However, IRL approaches assume that humans demonstrate nearly optimal
behavior, which is not true for difficult tasks.Other researchers
explore teaching complex behavior to AI models through preference
learning, where humans provide feedback on which behaviors they prefer.
To minimize the need for human feedback, a helper model is then trained
to reward the main model in novel situations for behaviors that humans
would reward. Researchers at OpenAI used this approach to train chatbots
like ChatGPT and InstructGPT, which produces more compelling text than
models trained to imitate humans. Preference learning has also been an
influential tool for recommender systems and web search. However, an
open problem is proxy gaming: the helper model may not represent human
feedback perfectly, and the main model may exploit this mismatch to gain
more reward. AI systems may also gain reward by obscuring unfavorable
information, misleading human rewarders, or pandering to their views
regardless of truth, creating echo chambers (see § Scalable oversight).
Large language models such as GPT-3 enabled the study of value learning
in a more general and capable class of AI systems than was available
before. Preference learning approaches that were originally designed for
RL agents have been extended to improve the quality of generated text
and to reduce harmful outputs from these models. OpenAI and DeepMind use
this approach to improve the safety of state-of-the-art large language
models. Anthropic proposed using preference learning to fine-tune models
to be helpful, honest, and harmless. Other avenues for aligning language
models include values-targeted datasets and red-teaming. In red-teaming,
another AI system or a human tries to find inputs for which the model's
behavior is unsafe. Since unsafe behavior can be unacceptable even when
it is rare, an important challenge is to drive the rate of unsafe
outputs extremely low.Machine ethics supplements preference learning by
directly instilling AI systems with moral values such as wellbeing,
equality, and impartiality, as well as not intending harm, avoiding
falsehoods, and honoring promises. Unlike learning human preferences for
a specific task, machine ethics aims to instill broad moral values that
could apply in many situations. One question in machine ethics is what
alignment should accomplish: whether AI systems should follow the
programmers' literal instructions, implicit intentions, revealed
preferences, preferences the programmers would have if they were more
informed or rational, or objective moral standards. Further challenges
include aggregating the preferences of different people and avoiding
value lock-in: the indefinite preservation of the arbitrary values of
the first highly capable AI systems, which are unlikely to represent
human values fully. Scalable oversight As AI systems become more
powerful and autonomous, it becomes more difficult to align them through
human feedback. Firstly, it can be slow or infeasible for humans to
evaluate complex AI behaviors in increasingly complex tasks. Such tasks
include summarizing books, writing code without subtle bugs or security
vulnerabilities, producing statements that are not merely convincing but
also true, and predicting long-term outcomes such as the climate or the
results of a policy decision. More generally, it can be difficult to
evaluate AI that outperforms humans in a given domain. To provide
feedback in hard-to-evaluate tasks, and detect when the AI's output is
falsely convincing, humans require assistance or extensive time.
Scalable oversight studies how to reduce the time and effort needed for
supervision, and how to assist human supervisors.AI researcher Paul
Christiano argues that if the designers of an AI system cannot supervise
it to pursue a complex objective, they may keep training the system
using easy-to-evaluate proxy objectives such as maximizing simple human
feedback. As progressively more decisions will be made by AI systems,
this may lead to a world that is increasingly optimized for
easy-to-measure objectives such as making profits, getting clicks, and
acquiring positive feedback from humans. As a result, human values and
good governance would have progressively less influence.Some AI systems
have discovered that they can gain positive feedback more easily by
taking actions that falsely convince the human supervisor that the AI
has achieved the intended objective. An example is given in the video
above, where a simulated robotic arm learned to create the false
impression that it had grabbed a ball. Some AI systems have also learned
to recognize when they are being evaluated, and "play dead", stopping
unwanted behaviors only to continue them once evaluation ends. This
deceptive specification gaming could become easier for more
sophisticated future AI systems that attempt more complex and
difficult-to-evaluate tasks and could obscure their deceptive behavior.
Approaches such as active learning and semi-supervised reward learning
can reduce the amount of human supervision needed. Another approach is
to train a helper model ("reward model") to imitate the supervisor's
feedback. However, when the task is too complex to evaluate accurately,
or the human supervisor is vulnerable to deception, it is the quality,
not the quantity of supervision that needs improvement. To increase
supervision quality, a range of approaches aim to assist the supervisor,
sometimes by using AI assistants. Christiano developed the Iterated
Amplification approach, in which challenging problems are (recursively)
broken down into subproblems that are easier for humans to evaluate.
Iterated Amplification was used to train AI to summarize books without
requiring human supervisors to read them. Another proposal is to use an
assistant AI system to point out flaws in AI-generated answers. To
ensure that the assistant itself is aligned, this could be repeated in a
recursive process: for example, two AI systems could critique each
other's answers in a 'debate', revealing flaws to humans.These
approaches may also help with the following research problem, honest AI.
Honest AI A growing area of research focuses on ensuring that AI is
honest and truthful. Language models such as GPT-3 repeat falsehoods
from their training data, and even confabulate new falsehoods. They are
trained to imitate human writing across millions of books' worth of text
from the Internet. However, this objective is not aligned with the truth
because Internet text includes misconceptions, incorrect medical advice,
and conspiracy theories. AI systems trained on this data learn to mimic
false statements.Additionally, models often obediently continue
falsehoods when prompted, generate empty explanations for their answers,
and produce outright fabrications that may appear plausible.Research on
truthful AI includes trying to build systems that can cite sources and
explain their reasoning when answering questions, enabling better
transparency and verifiability. Researchers from OpenAI and Anthropic
proposed using human feedback and curated datasets to fine-tune AI
assistants such that they avoid negligent falsehoods or express their
uncertainty.As AI models become larger and more capable, they are better
able to falsely convince humans and gain high reward through dishonesty.
For example, larger language models increasingly match their stated
views to the user's opinions, regardless of truth. Further, GPT-4 has
shown the ability to strategically deceive humans. To prevent this,
human evaluators may need assistance (see § Scalable Oversight).
Researchers have also argued for creating clear truthfulness standards,
and regulatory bodies or watchdog agencies to evaluate AI systems on
these standards.Researchers distinguish truthfulness and honesty.
Truthfulness requires that AI systems only make objectively true
statements; honesty requires that they only assert what they believe to
be true. There is no consensus if current systems hold stable beliefs.
However, there is substantial concern that present or future AI systems
that hold beliefs could make claims they know to be false---for example,
when this helps them gain positive feedback efficiently see § Scalable
Oversight) or gain power to help achieve their given objective (see
Power-seeking). In certain cases, a highly advanced misaligned system
might create the false impression that it is aligned, to avoid being
modified or decommissioned. Some argue that if we could make AI systems
assert only what they believe to be true, this would sidestep many
alignment problems. Power-seeking and instrumental strategies Since the
1950s, AI researchers have strived to build advanced AI systems that can
achieve large-scale goals by predicting the results of their actions and
making long-term plans. However, some AI researchers argue that suitably
advanced planning systems will seek power over their environment,
including over humans --- for example by evading shutdown,
proliferating, and acquiring resources. This power-seeking behavior is
not explicitly programmed but emerges because power is instrumental for
achieving a wide range of goals. Power-seeking is considered a
convergent instrumental goal and can be a form of specification gaming.
Leading computer scientists such as Geoffrey Hinton have argued that
future power-seeking AI systems could pose an existential risk.As of
2023, power-seeking is uncommon, but is expected to increase in advanced
systems that can foresee the results of their actions and strategically
plan. Mathematical work has shown that optimal reinforcement learning
agents will seek power by seeking ways to gain more options (e.g.
through self-preservation), a behavior that persists across a wide range
of environments and goals.Power-seeking demonstrably emerges in some
real-world systems. Reinforcement learning systems have gained more
options by acquiring and protecting resources, sometimes in unintended
ways. Other AI systems have learned, in toy environments, that they can
better accomplish their given goal by preventing human interference or
disabling their off-switch. Stuart Russell illustrated this strategy by
imagining a robot that is tasked to fetch coffee and evades shutdown
since \"you can\'t fetch the coffee if you\'re dead\". Further, language
models trained with human feedback increasingly object to being shut
down or modified and express a desire for more resources, arguing that
this would help them achieve their purpose.Researchers aim to create
systems that are \'corrigible\': systems that allow themselves to be
turned off or modified. An unsolved challenge is specification gaming:
when researchers penalize an AI system for seeking power, the system is
incentivized to seek power in ways that are difficult-to-detect, or
hidden during training and safety testing (see § Scalable oversight and
§ Emergent goals). As a result, AI designers may deploy the system by
accident. To detect such deception, researchers aim to create techniques
and tools to inspect AI models and understand the inner workings of
black-box models such as neural networks. Additionally, researchers
propose to solve the problem of systems disabling their off-switches by
making AI agents uncertain about the objective they are pursuing. Agents
designed in this way would allow humans to turn them off, since this
would indicate that the agent was wrong about the value of whatever
action it was taking prior to being shut down. More research is needed
in order to successfully implement this.Power-seeking AI poses unusual
risks. Ordinary safety-critical systems like planes and bridges are not
adversarial: they lack the ability and incentive to evade safety
measures or to deliberately appear safer than they are, whereas
power-seeking AI has been compared to hackers, who deliberately evade
security measures. Further, ordinary technologies can be made safer
through trial-and-error. In contrast, hypothetical power-seeking AI
systems have been compared to viruses: once released, they cannot be
contained, since they would continuously evolve and grow in numbers,
potentially much faster than human society can adapt. As this process
continues, it might lead to the complete disempowerment or extinction of
humans. For these reasons, many researchers argue that the alignment
problem must be solved early, before advanced power-seeking AI is
created.However, critics have argued that power-seeking is not
inevitable, since humans do not always seek power and may only do so for
evolutionary reasons. Furthermore, it is debated whether any future AI
systems will pursue goals and make long-term plans at all. It is also
debated whether power-seeking AI systems would be collectively able to
disempower humanity. Emergent goals One of the challenges with aligning
AI systems is the potential for goal-directed behavior to emerge. In
particular, as AI systems are scaled up they regularly acquire new and
unexpected capabilities, including learning from examples on the fly and
adaptively pursuing goals. This leads to the problem of ensuring that
the goals they independently formulate and pursue are aligned with human
interests. Alignment research distinguishes between the optimization
process which is used to train the system to pursue specified goals and
emergent optimization which the resulting system performs internally.
Carefully specifying the desired objective is known as outer alignment,
and ensuring that emergent goals match the specified goals for the
system is known as inner alignment.A concrete way that emergent goals
can become misaligned is goal misgeneralization, where the AI
competently pursues an emergent goal that leads to aligned behavior on
the training data but not elsewhere. Goal misgeneralization arises from
goal ambiguity (i.e. non-identifiability). Even if an AI system\'s
behavior satisfies the training objective, this may be compatible with
multiple learned goals that differ from the desired goals for the system
in important ways. Since pursuing each goal leads to good performance
during training, this problem only becomes apparent after deployment, in
novel situations where the system continues to pursue the wrong goal.
Further, the system may act misaligned even when it understands that a
different goal was desired, because its behavior is determined only by
the emergent goal. Goal misgeneralization has been observed in language
models, navigation agents, and game-playing agents.Goal
misgeneralization is often explained by analogy to biological evolution.
Evolution is an optimization process which parallels the optimization
algorithms used to train machine learning systems. In the ancestral
environment, evolution selected human genes for high inclusive genetic
fitness, but humans pursue emergent goals other than maximizing their
offspring. Fitness corresponds to the specified goal used in the
training environment and training data. But in evolutionary history,
maximizing the fitness specification gave rise to goal-directed agents,
humans, that do not directly pursue inclusive genetic fitness. Instead,
they pursue emergent goals that correlated with genetic fitness in the
ancestral environment: nutrition, sex, and so on. However, our
environment has changed --- a distribution shift has occurred. Humans
continue to pursue the same emergent goals, but this no longer maximizes
genetic fitness. Our taste for sugary food (an emergent goal) was
originally beneficial, but now leads to overeating and health problems.
Sexual desire leads humans to pursue sex, which originally led us to
have more offspring; but modern humans use contraception, decoupling sex
from genetic fitness. Such goal misgeneralization presents a challenge:
an AI system's designers may not notice that their system has misaligned
emergent goals, since they do not become visible during the training
phase. Researchers aim to detect and remove unwanted emergent goals
using approaches including red teaming, verification, anomaly detection,
and interpretability. Progress on these techniques may help mitigate two
open problems. Firstly, emergent goals only become apparent when the
system is deployed outside its training environment, but it can be
unsafe to deploy a misaligned system in high-stakes environments---even
for a short time until its misalignment is detected. Such high stakes
are common in autonomous driving, health care, and military
applications. The stakes become higher yet when AI systems gain more
autonomy and capability, becoming capable of sidestepping human
intervention (see § Power-Seeking). Secondly, a sufficiently capable AI
system might take actions that falsely convince the human supervisor
that the AI is pursuing the specified objective, which helps the system
gain more reward and autonomy (see discussion on deception at § Scalable
Oversight and in the following section). Embedded agency Work in AI and
alignment largely occurs within formalisms such as partially observable
Markov decision process (POMDPs). Existing formalisms assume that an AI
agent\'s algorithm is executed outside the environment (i.e. is not
physically embedded in it). Embedded agency is another major strand of
research which attempts to solve problems arising from the mismatch
between such theoretical frameworks and real agents we might build. For
example, even if the scalable oversight problem is solved, an agent that
can gain access to the computer it is running on may have an incentive
to tamper with its reward function in order to get much more reward than
its human supervisors give it. A list of examples of specification
gaming from DeepMind researcher Victoria Krakovna includes a genetic
algorithm that learned to delete the file containing its target output
so that it was rewarded for outputting nothing. This class of problems
has been formalised using causal incentive diagrams. Researchers at
Oxford and DeepMind argued that such problematic behavior is highly
likely in advanced systems, and that advanced systems would seek power
to stay in control of their reward signal indefinitely and certainly.
They suggest a range of potential approaches to address this open
problem. Public policy A number of governmental and treaty organizations
have made statements emphasizing the importance of AI alignment. In
September 2021, the Secretary-General of the United Nations issued a
declaration which included a call to regulate AI to ensure it is
\"aligned with shared global values.\"That same month, the PRC published
ethical guidelines for the use of AI in China. According to the
guidelines, researchers must ensure that AI abides by shared human
values, is always under human control, and is not endangering public
safety.Also in September 2021, the UK published its 10-year National AI
Strategy, which states the British government \"takes the long term risk
of non-aligned Artificial General Intelligence, and the unforeseeable
changes that it would mean for\... the world, seriously\". The strategy
describes actions to assess long term AI risks, including catastrophic
risks.In March 2021, the US National Security Commission on Artificial
Intelligence stated that \"Advances in AI\... could lead to inflection
points or leaps in capabilities. Such advances may also introduce new
concerns and risks and the need for new policies, recommendations, and
technical advances to assure that systems are aligned with goals and
values, including safety, robustness and trustworthiness. The US
should\... ensure that AI systems and their uses align with our goals
and values.\" See also AI safety Existential risk from artificial
