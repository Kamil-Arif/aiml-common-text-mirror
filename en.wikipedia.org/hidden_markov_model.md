A hidden Markov model (HMM) is a statistical Markov model in which the
system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process --- call it X
{\\displaystyle X} --- with unobservable (\"hidden\") states. As part of
the definition, HMM requires that there be an observable process Y
{\\displaystyle Y} whose outcomes are \"influenced\" by the outcomes of
X {\\displaystyle X} in a known way. Since X {\\displaystyle X} cannot
be observed directly, the goal is to learn about X {\\displaystyle X} by
observing Y . {\\displaystyle Y.} HMM has an additional requirement that
the outcome of Y {\\displaystyle Y} at time t = t 0 {\\displaystyle
t=t\_{0}} must be \"influenced\" exclusively by the outcome of X
{\\displaystyle X} at t = t 0 {\\displaystyle t=t\_{0}} and that the
outcomes of X {\\displaystyle X} and Y {\\displaystyle Y} at t \< t 0
{\\displaystyle t
