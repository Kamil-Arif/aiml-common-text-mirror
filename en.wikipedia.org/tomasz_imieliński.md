Tomasz Imieliński (born July 11, 1954, in Toruń, Poland) is a
Polish-American computer scientist, most known in the areas of data
mining, mobile computing, data extraction, and search engine technology.
He is currently a professor of computer science at Rutgers University in
New Jersey, United States. In 2000, he co-founded Connotate
Technologies, a web data extraction company based in New Brunswick, NJ.
Since 2004 till 2010 he had held multiple positions at Ask.com, from
vice president of data solutions intelligence to executive vice
president of global search and answers and chief scientist. From 2010 to
2012 he served as VP of data solutions at IAC/Pronto.Tomasz Imieliński
served as chairman of the Computer Science Department at Rutgers
University from 1996 to 2003. He co-founded Art Data Laboratories LLC
company, and its product, Articker is the largest known database that
aggregates dynamic non-price information about the visual artists in the
global art market. Articker has been under an exclusive partnership with
Phillips auction house. Education Tomasz Imieliński graduated with
B.E/M.E degree in electrical engineering from Politechnika Gdańska in
Gdańsk, Poland, and received his PhD, in 1982, in computer science, from
Polish Academy of Sciences, in Poland, under supervision of Witold
Lipski. Career After receiving his PhD, Tomasz Imieliński joined, for a
year, faculty at the McGill University School of Computer Science at
McGill University in Montreal. Since 1983, he joined the Computer
Science Department at Rutgers University, in New Brunswick. He served as
a chairman of the department, from 1996 to 2003. In 2000, he co-founded
Connotate Technologies based on his data extraction research developed
at Rutgers University. While on leave from Rutgers University, from 2004
to 2010, he had held multiple positions at Ask.com: vice president of
data solutions, executive vice president of global search and answers,
and chief scientist. Between 2010 and 2012, Tomasz Imieliński served as
vice president of data solutions at Pronto. Tomasz Imieliński received
numerous awards, such as 2018 The Tadeusz Sendzimir Applied Sciences
Award. Research and recognition Imieliński-Lipski Algebras Imieliński\'s
early work on \'Incomplete Information in Relational Databases\'
produced a fundamental concept that became later known as
Imieliński-Lipski Algebras.Cylindric Algebras According to Van den
Bussche, the first people from database community to recognize the
connection between Codd\'s relational algebra and Tarski\'s cylindric
algebras were Witold Lipski and Tomasz Imieliński, in a talk given at
the very first edition of PODS (the ACM Symposium on Principles of
Database Systems), in 1982. Their work,\"The relational model of data
and cylindric algebras\" was later published in 1984. Association Rule
Mining His joint 1993 paper with Agrawal and Swami, \'Mining Association
Rules Between Sets of Items in Large Databases\' started the association
rule mining research area, and it is one of the most cited publications
in computer science, with over 24,000 citations according to Google
Scholar. This paper received the 2003 - 10 year Test of Time ACM SIGMOD
award, and is included in the list of important publications in computer
science. Mobile Computing Imieliński has also been one of the pioneers
of mobile computing and for his joint 1992 paper with Badri Nath on
\'Querying in highly mobile distributed environments\' he received the
VLDB Ten Year Award in 2002.Geocast He proposed the idea of Geocast
which would deliver information to a group of destinations in a network
identified by their geographical locations. He proposed applications
such as geographic messaging, geographic advertising, delivery of
geographically restricted services, and presence discovery of a service
or mobile network participant in a limited geographic area.Patents
Overall, Imieliński has published over 150 papers and is an inventor and
co-inventor on multiple patents ranging from search technology to web
data extraction as well as multimedia processing, data mining, and
mobile computing (e.g. patent on \"Method and system for audio access to
information in a wide area computer network\"). His papers have been
cited over 43000 times. Tomasz Imieliński has been listed as #3, in the
area of databases, on the AMiner Most Influential Scholars List, which
tracks the top researchers in computer science and engineering. Other
Interests Tomasz Imieliński formed, in 2000, System Crash, an
avant-garde rock group which combined heavy sound with philosophical and
political lyrics and multimedia projection of videos and sounds of
current world, real and virtual. System Crash consisted of three
musicians Tomasz Imielinski vocal and guitar, James Jeude (bass) and
Tomek Unrat (drums). Since January 2006, the band had also gone by the
name of \"The Professor and System Crash\", the band title used on their
2006 re-printing of their 2005 CD \"War By Remote Control\". Internity,
the first show of System Crash, focused on the internet revolution and
its philosophical consequences -- interplay between the virtual and real
world, anthropomorphization of machines, programs and files. All lyrics
were written by Tomasz Imieliński. Internity was featured in Knitting
Factory, in 2001, and received enthusiastic reviews in Star Ledger and
New York Times. System Crash played to sold-out audiences and quickly
achieved cult status in the avant-garde music scene of New York City.
The group stopped performing around 2007. References Other selected
